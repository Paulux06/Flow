# flow
My vocal assistant, like a cheap Jibo (and only in french for the moment because I'm french)
this code is in Python, only snowboy is in c++

/!\ Warning /!\
Only work on Linux or MacOS, because I use snowboy for keywords detection and it's not available on Windows yet.

You have just to download with 'Clone or download', to install a hundred of dependencies, and compile the snowboy code to run that =)

not easy ?

Ok, I'll make a newer version (later) with a setup.sh or a installation file like that to make it easier !

If you read this, please go to snowboy.kitt.ai and record your voice saying 'Flow', to have more differents voices and more powerful word recognition engine, thanks ! =)
