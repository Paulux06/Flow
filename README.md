My vocal assistant, like a cheap Jibo (and only in french for the moment because I'm french)

/!\ Warning /!\
Only work on Linux or MacOS, because I use snowboy for keywords detection and it's not available on Windows yet.

You have just to download with 'Clone or download', to install a hundred of dependencies, and compile the snowboy code to run that =)
Ok, i'll make a newer version with a setup.sh or a installation file like that to make it easier !
